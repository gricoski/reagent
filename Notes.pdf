The template needed me to state what compiler. I wanted to use
My choice and the turotial uses shadow-cljs
I also wanted lein template setup for reagent
Then I wanted it to cd to the folder I created

I used this line in ubuntu terminal
$ lein new shadow-cljs breaking-bad-quotes +reagent && cd breaking-bad-quotes

I made sure I had shadow-cljs installed

What I removed:
