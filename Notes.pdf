;;Working off this tutorial:: https://www.rockyourcode.com/tutorial-clojurescript-app-with-reagent-for-beginners-part-1
;;Reframe Tutorial

First, I created a template to work from using leins.
The template needed me to state what compiler. I wanted to use
My choice and the turotial uses shadow-cljs
I also wanted lein template setup for reagent
Then I wanted it to cd to the folder I created

I used this line in ubuntu terminal
$ lein new shadow-cljs breaking-bad-quotes +reagent && cd breaking-bad-quotes

I made sure I had shadow-cljs installed

First, I can see what it looks like by running this commad
$ shadow-cljs watch app
Then going into browser here: http://localhost:8700

It showed me that I had to install React...
***$ Npm install react

Next I worked on adding the css in the style.css file in public folder

Next I go to te core.cljs in src and remove some boilerplate

**
How I got this in git.

Made repository in Git with no new readme or anything files
Then copied the files to a new location with out the git folder
Then typed: 
git init
git commit -m "First commit"
//This gave me an error of nothing added to commit but unchecked files, but I continued on
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/gricoski/reagent.git'
git push push -u origin master
//This failed with "error: src refspec master..."
//I retrited a few times, but eventually I typed...
git add .
git commit -m "Not first Try"
git push origin master
//This worked... Problem was that I didn't say "git add ." to add the files...

**
Tomorrow I will remove code from template and add what tutorial says:
What I removed:

First I $npm install react
Then chcekd to see what it looked like with:
$ shadow-cljs watch app
Then going into browser here: http://localhost:8700
...Had to install $npm install create-react-class
...Had to install $npm install react-dom
HINT: use Ctrl-C to get out of bash prorams...
..That worked

All together react depencies needed to install with Npm:
npm install react
npm install create-react-class
npm install react-dom

No changes were automaticaly happening in broswer when I saved...
Relized I was in the wrong directory...
... I had to reinstall React again???


Data structures are immutable in clojure, but we need changes. so we use atom
Atom - a container that holds mutable values
Use @ to peak into it's state?

What I removed from Template:

(comment
;; define your app data so that it doesn't get over-written on reload
;;Old Stuff down below...
(defonce app-state (atom {:text "Hello world!"}))

(defn hello-world []
  [:div
   [:h1 (:text @app-state)]
   [:h3 "Edit this and watch what change!"]
   [:h2 "I love you, Vienna!!!"]])

(defn start []
  (reagent/render-component [hello-world]
                            (. js/document (getElementById "app"))))

(defn ^:export init []
  ;; init is called ONCE when the page loads
  ;; this is called in the index.html and must be exported
  ;; so it is available even in :advanced release builds
  (start))

(defn stop []
  ;; stop is called before any code is reloaded
  ;; this is controlled by :before-load in the config
  (js/console.log "stop"))
)

The code was replaced with hiccup style...
Wiki here review again tomorrow:  https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/wiki/Syntax

****Afer This work on Reframe****


Old quote function:
(defn quote []
     (let [data (atom nil)]
          (fetch-link! data) ;;adding teh fetch-link function above to pull data in to quote function
          (fn []
              (let [{:strs [quote auther]} (first @data)
                   tweet-intent (str "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=breakingbad&text=" quote " ~ " author)]
               [:div.cards>div.card
               [:h2.card-header.text-center "I love Vienna"]
               [:div.card-body.text-center
               [:p#quote @data]  ;;@If you don't de-ref with @, broswer won't disply "quote app"
               [:p#author @data]]
               [:div.card-footer.center.text-center
               [:button#twitter.outline>a#tweet  ;;Creates outer HTML element with a button with ID twiiter and class outline
               {:href "#"  ;;Inside this element a nest HTML Link with id Tweet
               :target "_blank"}
               [:i.fi-social-twitter " Tweet"]]
               [:button#new-quote.outline
                    {:on-click #(fetch-link! data) }
               [:i.fi-shuffle " Don't Push"]]]]))))


Some Notes:

    try to get a sketch of the app as soon as possible: mockup the app with Hiccup templating and hard-coded data
    
    start with a knowledge of how your data is structured: I knew I would get a JSON object from the API with the keys "author" and "quote" and their values as strings
    
    incremental design: at first I was not sure how to destructure the JSON object, so I just tried to display the complete JSON and improved the design from there
   
    an eye on UI: I knew I wanted to use Wing CSS so I made sure to include the correct classes into Hiccup/HTML right from the start instead of re-arranging the stuff later
   
    sometimes things are easier than they look: it took me many experiments to get the Twitter web intent right because I tried some arcane stuff instead of just constructing a string out of the url and the (already destructured) dataset - it helps to take a step back and just sleep on it

;;Next part would be setting it up in google Firebase
https://www.rockyourcode.com/tutorial-clojurescript-app-with-reagent-for-beginners-part-2

Next I'm uploading to google firebase for deployment.
I first install firebase with npm using this line:
$npm install --save firebase
