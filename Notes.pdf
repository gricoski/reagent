First, I created a template to work from using leins.
The template needed me to state what compiler. I wanted to use
My choice and the turotial uses shadow-cljs
I also wanted lein template setup for reagent
Then I wanted it to cd to the folder I created

I used this line in ubuntu terminal
$ lein new shadow-cljs breaking-bad-quotes +reagent && cd breaking-bad-quotes

I made sure I had shadow-cljs installed

First, I can see what it looks like by running this commad
$ shadow-cljs watch app
Then going into browser here: http://localhost:8700

It showed me that I had to install React...
***$ Npm install react

Next I worked on adding the css in the style.css file in public folder

Next I go to te core.cljs in src and remove some boilerplate

**
How I got this in git.

Made repository in Git with no new readme or anything files
Then copied the files to a new location with out the git folder
Then typed: 
git init
git commit -m "First commit"
//This gave me an error of nothing added to commit but unchecked files, but I continued on
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/gricoski/reagent.git'
git push push -u origin master
//This failed with "error: src refspec master..."
//I retrited a few times, but eventually I typed...
git add .
git commit -m "Not first Try"
git push origin master
//This worked... Problem was that I didn't say "git add ." to add the files...

Tomorrow I will remove code from template and add what tutorial says:
